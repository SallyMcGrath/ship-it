    <p>Victoria Wood CBE (19 May 1953 â€“ 20 April 2016) was an English comedian, actress, lyricist, singer, composer, pianist, screenwriter, producer and director.</p>

    <p>Wood wrote and starred in dozens of sketches, plays, musicals, films and sitcoms over several decades and her live comedy act was interspersed with her own compositions which she performed at the piano. Much of her humour was grounded in everyday life and included references to activities, attitudes and products that are considered to exemplify Britain. She was noted for her skills in observational comedy and in satirising aspects of social class.</p>
